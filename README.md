## GAME SAVES
-New Game-
    A new game is made with all pieces in the starting position. If there was a previous game played it must be saved before creating a new game else it will be lost.

-Save Game-
    With a game save selected on the side you choose which save will store the active game locally. Will show the time/date it was saved.

-Load Game-
    Selecting on a game save and pressing this button will load the locally saved game onto the board from where it was last placed.
